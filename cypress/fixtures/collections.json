            "This collection features digital copies of 113 antique maps of Africa and accompanying text dating from the mid-16th Century to the early 20th Century. All scanned maps are authentic and originally collected by the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies. Melville J. Herskovits established Northwestern University's Program of African Studies in 1948 (the first of its kind at a major research university in the United States). The Herskovits Library, formally created as a separate library in 1954, has since its inception collected maps that describe Africa from their earliest appearance to the most current. Map area coverage includes the continent, regions (particularly North Africa and Algeria), islands (particularly Madagascar), and a few city plans. All of these maps are loose items, though many have been excised from published atlases. Some of the highlights of the digital collection are: a series of Ptolemic maps of North Africa by Ruscelli, ca. 1565; Forlani: Africa , 1562; Mercator: Africa, 1595; Blaeu: Æthiopia ca. 1650 (a Prester John map); Carey: Africa, 1795 (first map of Africa published in the United States), Arrowsmith: Africa, 1802 (notable for its large dimensions, 124 x 145 cm.), a series of Algerian maps published by the French government in the mid-1800's, and maps by other notable cartographers, such as Hondius, Jansson, de Jode, de L'Isle, Ortelius, Sanson, and de Wit. The original maps are kept and maintained in the map collection in the Government \u0026 Geographic Information Collection. We welcome questions, comments, and suggestions concerning any aspect of this digital collection, particularly with regards to provenance. Other antique maps from the Herskovits Library which were not included in this digital collection are either duplicate copies or other editions, such as French government sets covering Algeria."

            "James (Jim) Roberts earned his bachelor’s degree from Northwestern University, master’s and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Iowa, and an M.B.A. from Duke’s Fuqua School of Business. He currently serves as the Executive Vice Provost for Finance and Administration at Duke University. The James Roberts photographs range in date from 1968-1972, the years when Roberts was a student at Northwestern. Although Roberts was a history major, his primary passion was photography, and he considers its practice a substantial part of his education. Roberts arrived at Northwestern in 1968. He quickly became acquainted with the photography community in Evanston, and in 1969 joined the staff of the Syllabus yearbook. During 1969-1972, Roberts documented Northwestern life intensively, and made occasional forays into the surrounding Evanston and Chicago environs. He also spent a quarter studying abroad in Cuernavaca, Mexico at the Centro Intercultural de Documentation, an important site of Catholic social activism in Mexico. The late 1960s and early 1970s were remarkable years at Northwestern, in Chicago, and around the world. The photos Roberts took, many published in the ’70, ’71, and ’72 editions of the Syllabus, artfully documented both the mundane (i.e. Evanston street scenes, football games, dining hall kitchen staff) and the extraordinary (i.e., the March on Washington, Vietnam War protests, student clashes with police, and street life in Mexico)."

            "Gift of the Deering Family. These sketches by Catalan artist Ramón Casas (1866-1932) document the work of an under-represented artist who was influential in modernist art circles in Barcelona and Paris along with his peers John Singer Sargent, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and the young Pablo Picasso. Three bound hardcover volumes of sketches came to the Northwestern University Libraries in 1998 as part of a donation of books that had belonged to NU benefactor Charles Deering (1852-1927). Deering and Casas met in 1904 and established a lifelong friendship. At some point before the donation, a few hundred loose Casas drawings, postcards, and illustrated letters dating from 1891 to 1912 were bound into their current form. There were at least five volumes in the set; two remain in private collections."

            "Series 31/6/155, Photographs: Folder 4 - The following images are from the events of the May 3, 1968 Bursar’s Office Takeover, the first student protest at Northwestern University. On April 22, 1968, members of Black student organizations, For Members Only (FMO) and African American Student Union (AASU), presented a list of demands to the Northwestern University administration regarding discriminatory campus policies and practices. When the demands were not met, on May 3, 1968, approximately 120 African American students occupied the Bursar’s Office, Northwestern University’s business office. The demonstration lasted for 38 hours when members of FMO and AASU and the administration ultimately reached a compromise on May 4, 1968. This effort successfully led to the “May 4th agreement” in which the University promised enhanced support for African American students regarding admission, financial aid, housing, curriculum, and counseling, as well as an official statement by the administration admitting to the existence of institutional racism at the University. Notably, it also prompted the creation of the Department of African American Studies and a social space for Black students on campus, known as the Black House."

            "The Charles Deering McCormick of Special Collections contains a collection of about 8,000 items relating to the Siege and Commune of Paris of 1870-1871. This collection is the largest held on this subject in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. This diverse and visually exciting array includes original photographs, caricatures, posters, etchings, lithographs, books, newspapers, manuscripts and realia created during and in reaction to l'année terrible: the epoch-changing year that witnessed France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the downfall of the Second Empire, the hardship and suffering of the four-month siege of Paris, and the bloody civil war that snuffed out the Commune uprising.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the collection was acquired in 1971, the centenary year of end of the Commune, when astute Northwestern University librarians purchased almost en bloc the catalogue offerings of a prominent French book dealer. Since that time it has been augmented by many successive acquisitions. Along with the American Civil War and the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War was one of the first to be documented photographically. Photographs of the war and of the ruined Paris landscape it and the struggle with the Communards caused abound, as well as some of the earliest examples of manipulated fake photographs created for propaganda purposes.
